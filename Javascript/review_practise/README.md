# A practise repository for process workshops and reviews

Feedback from Review 1:

#### Focus on:

- Red - Green - COMMIT! - Refactor
- Create the input-output table and start with the simplest inputs

#### Tests:

- How many things am I testing here?
  If this answer is not 1 then ask:
- How many things have I already tested?

### Practise Codewars TDD:

#### April 15th: 8kyu, Javascript, 10mins:

Imagine you are creating a game where the user has to guess the correct number. But there is a limit of how many guesses the user can do.

- If the user tries to guess more than the limit, the function should throw an error.
- If the user guess is right it should return true.
- If the user guess is wrong it should return false and lose a life.

Create the game game so all the rules are met.

number of tries = 3
number = 10
let guesser = Guess.new(10,3)

| Input             | Output                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| guesser.guess(10) | true                       |
| guesser.guess(1)  |                            |
| guesser.guess(9)  |                            |
| guesser.guess(9)  | Error: "you no lives left" |
| guesser.guess(9)  | false                      |
| guesser.guess(9)  |                            |
| guesser.lives     | 2                          |

#### Reflection:

- started this from the beginning not half way complete so it took longer than 10mins
- the coverage report was helpful and enabled me to write tests to cover those lines.

Your task here is to define how much coffee you need to stay awake after your night. You will have to complete a function that take an array of events in arguments, according to this list you will return the number of coffee you need to stay awake during day time. Note: If the count exceed 3 please return 'You need extra sleep'.

The list of events can contain the following:

You come here, to solve some kata ('cw').

You have a dog or a cat that just decide to wake up too early ('dog' or 'cat').

You just watch a movie ('movie').

Other events can be present and it will be represent by arbitrary string, just ignore this one.

Each event can be downcase/lowercase, or uppercase. If it is downcase/lowercase you need 1 coffee by events and if it is uppercase you need 2 coffees.

#### Reflection:

- This took quite a long time - maybe 1 hour in total over a few days
- I wrote more production code than necessary to pass the tests I think as that meant
  some tests just passed straight away, potentially my tests are too broken down?

You have cultivated a plant, and after months of hard work, the time has come to reap the flowers of your hard work. When it was growing, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time check how much your plant has grown.

A plant is represented horizontally, from the base to the left, to the end to the right:

---@---@---@
The stem is represented by hyphens -, and the flowers are represented by symbols. A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.

Four parameters will be given. The four parameters are:

```
seed (string) - determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.
water (integer) - each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers. It also gives how many times the stems + flower clusters should be repeated
fert (integer) - each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters
temp (integer) - if the temperature given is in the range of 20°C and 30°C, the plant grows normally, otherwise, all the flowers die except for one flower at the end of the stem.
```

| Input         | Output                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| "@", 1, 1, 20 | "-@"                       |
| "!", 1, 1, 20 | "-!"                       |
| "@", 2, 1, 20 | "--@--@"                   |
| "@", 1, 2, 20 | "-@@"                      |
| "@", 2, 2, 20 | "--@@--@@"                 |
| "@", 2, 2, 19 | "----@"                    |
| "$", 4, 2, 30 | "----$$----$$----$$----$$" |

The company you work for has just been awarded a contract to build a payment gateway. In order to help move things along, you have volunteered to create a function that will take a float and return the amount formatting in dollars and cents.

```
39.99 becomes $39.99
```

The rest of your team will make sure that the argument is sanitized before being passed to your function although you will need to account for adding trailing zeros if they are missing (though you won't have to worry about a dangling period).

```
3 needs to become $3.00
3.1 needs to become $3.10
```

| Input | Output   |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1.99  | "$1.99"  |
| 12.99 | "$12.99" |
| 3     | "$3.00"  |
| 3.1   | "$3.10"  |
